                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language that 
                tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. 
                It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer 
                wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which 
                you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content 
                to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can 
                make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize 
                words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:
            </p>
            <pre class="pre-section">My cat is very grumpy</pre>
            <p class="paragraph-section">
                If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph (<code>&ltp/&gt</code>) element:
            </p>
            <code class="code-section">
                <p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
            </code>

            <p class="paragraph-section">Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section:</p>

            alt="A sample code snippet demonstrating the structure of an html element.<p> My cat is very grumpy </p>.">
            <p class="paragraph-section">The anatomy of our element is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), 
                    wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins 
                    or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The closing tag:</strong>This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash 
                    before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common 
                    beginner error that can produce peculiar results.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="paragraph-section">
                The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.

            <p class="paragraph-section">
                Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to state 
                that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a <code> &ltstrong/&gt </code> 
                element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:
            </p>
            <code class="code-section">
                &ltp&gtMy cat is &ltstrong&gt very &ltstrong/&gt grumpy.&ltp/&gt
            </code>
            <p class="paragraph-section">
                There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the p element 
                first, then opened the strong element. For proper nesting, we should close the strong element 
                first, before closing the p.
            </p>
            <code class="code-section error">
                &ltp&gtMy cat is &ltstrong&gt very grumpy.&ltp/&gt&ltstrong/&gt
            </code>
            <p class="paragraph-section">
                The tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another. 
                With the kind of overlap in the example above, the browser has to guess at your intent. 
                This kind of guessing can result in unexpected results.

            <header>Block versus inline elements</header>
            <p class="paragraph-section">
                There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level elements and inline elements.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line 
                    following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also appears 
                    on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page. For example, a 
                    block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or footers. 
                    A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside 
                    another block-level element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the document's 
                    content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element will not cause a new line to appear 
                    in the document. It is typically used with text, for example an &lta&gt element creates a hyperlink, and elements 
                    such as &ltem&gt or &ltstrong&gt create emphasis.
                </li>
            </ul>
