                Portgas D. Ace, born as Gol D. Ace and nicknamed "Fire Fist" Ace, was the sworn older 
                brother of Luffy and Sabo, and the biological son of the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, 
                and Portgas D. Rouge. Ace was adopted by Monkey D. Garp, as had been requested by Roger 
                before his execution. Ace was the 2nd division commander of the Whitebeard Pirates and 
                one-time captain of the Spade Pirates.

                Hunted by the World Government for his lineage, Ace was captured and sentenced to death, 
                which resulted in the Summit War of Marineford, an all-out clash of powers; Whitebeard's 
                forces against the Marines and Seven Warlords. Ace was freed, but he sacrificed his 
                life to protect Luffy from Marine admiral Akainu.

                Ace was first shown during the Drum Island Arc, but only got formally introduced in the 
                Arabasta Arc, where he acts as a brief ally of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is a central 
                figure during the whole Summit War Saga. He is also the protagonist of Ace's Great Blackbeard 
                Search Cover Page Serial.

                Ace's death ultimately proved to be the catalyst leading to Luffy training for two years to 
                become strong enough to protect his friends, paving the way for the second half of the series.
